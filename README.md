# ue4-vive-modular-pawn
A modular pawn setup for using the HTC Vive, and it's Motion Controllers, in the Unreal Engine.

**IMPORTANT: This isn't ready for production use yet and so shouldn't really be used..**

## Overview
There are a number of different input approaches used with the HTC Vive motion controller, and this project is to provide a modular system which will support most of these.

There are two parallel versions, one in pure Blueprint and one using C++ as a base, and each of which will have a series of simple VR demos showing the interactivity principles being implemented.
